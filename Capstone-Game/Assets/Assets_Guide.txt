For ease of use generally we sort assets by type in Unity.
The folders we have currently are:

-Builds: For builds of the game. Is ignored in git by default.
-Editor: For scripts that change the editor. DW about this ;)
-Resources: All traditional assets. Create sub files as necessary.
   -Art: 2D art, UI etc.
   -Models: 3D models and Rigs.
   -Music: music.
   -Particles: particle systems and assets exclusive to them.
   -Prefabs: ANY prefab you make should go here.
   -Sounds: SFX.
-Scenes: scenes
   -TeamScenes: When you want to edit a scene make a copy of it called.
	[SCENE NAME]_[YOUR NAME] and put it in here to avoid conflicts.
-Scripts: all C# scripts (except editor) should go here.
-StoreAssets: any assets or packages we get from elsewhere (e.g. unity store)

**IMPORTANT NOTE**
Any assets you want to load during the runtime of the game need to be
in a folder called 'Resources', which is why I keep all of them in there
by default. We might seperate them when we get to opimization but for 
now that's why the folder is called that. Prefabs ESPECIALLY need to
be in the Resources folder or they are much harder to use.

Editor scripts allow us to add automatic processes and things like
buttons to the editor, but they need to be in a folder called
'Editor' to work. If you're finding something difficult/repetetive
ask if we can make a script to help.
