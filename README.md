  You, a cheeky Texan squirrel find a crate full of food just lying around, so you hop in and eat it all! Problem is, the crate was headed for Australia, and belongs to a mean group of koalas led by Koala King, and you quickly find yourself indebted to them to return the missing food. They show you a nearby town to get this food â€“ with no other choice, you agree to help them. But will you put up with it forever, or will you rise up and claim this new place as your own?

  This is the work of Game Group 4 for their Capstone project.
